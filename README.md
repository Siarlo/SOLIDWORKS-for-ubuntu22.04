## Context

This project is original from : https://github.com/cryinkfly/SOLIDWORKS-for-Linux
At the time of fork, many simple logic erros were present making it hard for a less experienced user to downlaod and execute the script.

This will help you install and run Solidworks on Ubuntu 22.04 (Which is the version I'm currently using)
The original github repo allowed for different linux distributions, but I do not have the knowledge to support all of those. 


## Hardware and Software Requirements

- Internet connection (Cable/DSL speeds recommended)
- Latest Ubuntu 22.04
- Latest graphics driver
- Some packages (p7zip, p7zip-full, p7zip-rar, curl, wget, winbind, cabextract, wine, wine-mono, wine_gecko & winetricks)
